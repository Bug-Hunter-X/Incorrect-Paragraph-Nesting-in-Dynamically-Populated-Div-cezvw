# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect Paragraph Nesting
This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to incorrect nesting of paragraph tags when dynamically populating content using JavaScript.

The bug arises from the way some browsers interpret nested paragraphs within dynamically generated content. The issue does not always manifest, making it more difficult to detect.

## Bug Description
The bug occurs when a paragraph (`<p>`) tag is directly placed inside another paragraph tag within a dynamically populated div using JavaScript's `innerHTML`. Some browsers might fail to render the inner `paragraph` element correctly.

## Solution
The solution is to avoid nesting `paragraph` tags.  Instead, use a container element like a `div` or `span` to wrap the content that would otherwise be placed inside a nested paragraph. This ensures proper rendering across various browsers.
